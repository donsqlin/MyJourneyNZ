This app was created as a part of Accenture New Zealand's Technology Bootcamp 2023.

The bootcamp, held over 4 days in June, guided us from ideation to implementation. With mentorship and workshops, we brought the app from a business idea to a functional solution. Workshops included design thinking, a Figma tutorial, agile methodologies, and automation.

The final day of the bootcamp culminated in a presentation to a judging panel. Our team was awarded Runner Up for our innovative product and comprehensive presentation.
